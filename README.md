# Urban Cooling Modeling in Yonkers, NY 
This repository contains a brief overview of the Fall 2021 NASA DEVELOP Yonkers Urban Development II project, which leveraged NASA Earth Observations to Support Modeling Urban Cooling Interventions and Urban Heat Vulnerability in Yonkers, New York. Many of the results of this work are still undergoing NASAâ€™s export control process, so details are limited at present. This project was conducted in partnership with Groundwork Hudson Valley, a social and environmental advocacy organization promoting equity, leadership, and economic opportunity for youth in Yonkers.

## Datasets Used:
* Landsat 8 TIRS 
* ISS ECOSTRESS
* American Community Survey (ACS) U.S. Census Bureau 
* National Landcover Database (NLCD) *2019*

## Objectives: 
* Heat Vulnerability Analysis: Produce an updated heat vulnerability index based on vulnerability variables identified by the New York State Department of Health 
* Thermal Comfort Analysis: Model outdoor thermal comfort benefits in identified high heat-vulnerability sites by simulating increased tree canopy interventions
* Landcover Distribution per Capita: Calculate the area of greenspace / area of impervious surface per person
* Heat Literacy Graphics: Produce ArcGIS StoryMap to help with understanding of urban heat impacts
